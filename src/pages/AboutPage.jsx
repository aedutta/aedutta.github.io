    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an undergraduate at UIUC, majoring in computer engineering and minoring in math. While my future plans are
      still forming, I’m considering graduate school in EE/CS (either a master’s or Ph.D.) and envision working in
      industry—possibly at a startup or in a research/technical role at a larger corporation.

      My passion for computer engineering stems from my high school interest in physics. I competed in physics contests
      like the USA Physics Olympiad and founded the Online Physics Olympiad, which has grown into a 15k-member community.
      However, in my senior year, I realized I was more drawn to physics because of its applications rather than its
      abstractions. I wanted to solve practical problems and make a tangible impact, which led me to explore engineering.
      ECE offered the perfect blend of breadth and depth, allowing me to explore hardware, software, and systems design
      while staying grounded in my love for problem-solving and applied science.
