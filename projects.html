  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>This is a place where I add anything that I have spent a lot of time on and would like to share.
	<h5>Research</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://www.wagglenet.org/">WaggleNet</a> under Prof. Christopher Schmitz. We design, build, develop and deploy IoT solutions for beekeepers. I am working on the audio team to combine hardware and software to get audio input from bees and predict their behaviors using machine learning models.</li>
	    <li>In Spring 2024, I was a research scholar at the <a href="https://iml.math.illinois.edu/">Illinois Mathematics Lab</a> where I worked on a semester-long project on <a href="IML_SP4.pdf">Simulation Costs for Quantum Dynamical Semigroups
Generated by Lindbladians</a>.</li>
	    </ul>
	<h5>Finished Projects</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="spectrumviewer.pdf">Analog Spectrum Viewer</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ashmitdutta.xyz/animations">Generative Art</a> 
        <li>Computer Vision AR glasses. <i>Progress:</i> My team won second place at the Bradley Mottier Innovation Competition at UIUC pitching a startup idea, leading to us winning $2000.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>High School</h3>
                <p>Throughout high school, I was deeply involved in physics olympiads. Below are a couple key contributions of mine as an active member of this community.</p>
    <h5>
      Outreach
    </h5>
  <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://opho.physoly.tech"/>Online Physics Olympiad</a>. This is the biggest international student-run physics olympiad in the world. I co-founded the competition during COVID-19 and currently manage a team of 20+ volunteers. Over 4 years, I have written dozens of challenging physics problems while planning out most of the logistics for the competition.</li>
      <li> <a href ="https://www.everaise.org/course/physics">Everaise Academy</a>. This is a course designed to teach students the fundamentals of classical mechanics. I helped design the course content and wrote over 5 chapters of the published textbook on Amazon. While you can purchase the physical copy there, I may be able to give you a free copy if you contact me. </li>
      <li> <a href="https://physoly.tech/kalda/">Solutions to Jaan Kalda's Handouts</a>. These contain almost 300 pages of solutions and translations to Jaan Kalda's olympiad handouts. I served as the head author for several of the solution guides.</li>
                <li> <a href="https://discord.gg/phods">Physoly</a>. I directed an online community of 10k+ physics enthusiasts to create resources/translations for physics olympiads. We were official partners with Discord and I oversaw a YouTube channel with 850+ subscribers. This is a great community to join as it consists of several talented members who can give advice and even those who competed internationally!</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Handouts</h5>
                <ul>
      <li> <a href="Lagrangian_Handout (2).pdf">Lagrangian Handout</a>. (Last updated 2021). This handout is not meant to provide a rigorous introduction to lagrangian mechanics presented in undergraduate physics. However, it will go through a practical step by step process such that a person who understands the theory and examples presented in this handout will be able to solve olympiad physics problems through the usage of lagrangian formalism.</li>
      <li> <a href="ST_handout (1).pdf">Surface Tension Handout (Partial)</a>. (Last updated 2022). Surface tension is a topic that many textbooks neglect. This leaves many olympians confused when given problems about surface tension. This handout attempts to give an introduction to the theory of surface tension as well as giving several examples and problems for the reader to attempt. </li>
        </ul>
      <h5>
        High School Research/Projects
      </h5>
  
      <ul>
          <li> <a href="feynman.pdf">Path Integral Formulation and Feynmann Diagrams</a>. (Last updated 2022) These are the solutions my team wrote to get second place in the 2022 Physics Unlimited Explorer Competition. In the 2022 competition, we explored the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and Feynman diagrams. 
          <li> <a href = "resonance (3).pdf">An Analytic Model of Stable and Unstable Orbital Resonance</a>. (Last updated 2021). Published peer-reviewed abstract and accepted to present "An Analytic Model of Stable and Unstable Orbital Resonance" (theoretical astrophysics research) at LPSC 2021, the world's premier planetary science conference hosted by Lunar and Planetary Institute and NASA Johnson Space Center.
	  <li> <a href="2021_PUEC.pdf">Designing a Quantum Cascade Laser</a> These are solutions my team wrote to get a honorable mention in the 2021 Physics Unlimited Explorer Competition.</li>
          <li> <a href="BL4S_Document.pdf">Channeling Across a Body-Centered Cubic Crystal</a>. (Last updated 2020). This was a particle physics experiment proposal submitted to the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) during the Beamline for Schools competition. This proposal became shortlisted (top 20) out of hundreds of submitted proposals around the world. I hope that this is a good reference for anyone interested in BL4S. 
            </ul>
            <h5>
              Translations & Solution Manuals
            </h5>
            <ul>
            <li> <a href="INPhO_2011_Solutions (3).pdf">2011 Indian Physics Olympiad</a>. <a href="INPhO_2012_Solutions (1).pdf">2012 Indian Physics Olympiad</a>. There are a few exams from the Indian Physics Olympiad that do not have solutions. 
      <li> <a href="MIT_OCW_8_03_Solutions_Manual (4).pdf">MIT OCW 8.03 Solutions Manual (Partial)</a>. (Last updated 2021). These are solutions to MIT OpenCourseWare's Vibrations & Waves Class taught in 2016 by Prof. Yen-Jie Lee. 
        <li> <a href="MIT_OCW_8_04_Solutions_Manual (6).pdf">MIT OCW 8.04 Solutions Manual (Partial)</a>. (Last updated 2022). These are solutions to MIT OpenCourseWare's Quantum Mechanics 1 class taught in 2016 by Prof. Barton Zwiebach. 
          </ul>
          <h5>
            Notes & Slides
          </h5>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="LRLvec.pdf">Laplace-Runge-Lenz Vector</a> This was taught in office hours at Everaise Academy 2022. The slides alone are difficult to understand as there are no words, however, I think it may be a useful resource nevertheless. 
	</li>
            <li> <a href="AP_Physics_C_EM_Notes (1).pdf">AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Notes</a>. These are notes I wrote while preparing for the E&M exam where I got a 5. </li>
              </ul>
